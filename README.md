# Raspberry-PI-Project
Autonomous security system using a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Camera Module. When movement is detected, it triggers a video recording, which is stored locally on a USB drive. This drive is simultaneously configured as a Network Attached Storage (NAS), allowing authorized devices on the local network to access and review footage in real-time.
